This app given several pics of paddy leaves tells whether it needs fertilizer(urea) or not and the amount of fertilizer. It gives result for "Boro" and "Ropa" these two types of paddy. This app is based on a simple logic. It is given the RGB value of different pixels of paddy leaves taken from leaf color chart(LCC). A picture of leaf color chart is given below:

These different levels of LCC indicate if it is necessary to apply fertilizer or not. These layers have different RGB values. The app compares RGB value of a new image and given RGB value of different layers of LCC. It gets confused with green color having pixel value in that range as picture having green in it can have RGB value in the given range as it is comparing few pixels of the taken picture. The app when started first gives an introduction about how to use it. <br>

It then asks for which type of paddy the user will be taking picture of.<br>

If it can't find green pixel in the image it discards the image and prompts the user to take picture again or choose picture from gallery.<br>
