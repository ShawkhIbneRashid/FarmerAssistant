From images of paddy leaves, this andorid app tells whether a paddy field requires fertilizer or not. It compares pixel values of an image of a paddy leaf with a leaf color chart to determine at what stage that leaf is. A picture of leaf color chart is given below:

These different levels of LCC indicate if it is necessary to apply fertilizer or not. These layers have different RGB values. The app compares RGB values of a new image and given RGB value of different layers of LCC. At first this app gives an introduction about how to use it. <br>

It then asks for which type of paddy the user will be taking picture of.<br>

Then it prompts the user to take picture or choose one from gallery. Later it provides the user with the result.<br>

If it can't find green pixel in the image it discards the image and prompts the user to take picture again or choose picture from gallery.<br>

We worked on this project as a teeam of three in National Hackathon 2016 and Robo-Droid Championship-2016. We won the motivational award in Robo-Droid championship for this Android app. The certificate can be accessed using this <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/shawkh/certificates/robo-droid?authuser=1">link</a>.
